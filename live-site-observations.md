# Live Site Observations (gtmplanetary.com)

## MEET AI Animation
- The "MEET AI" text has a strong purple/magenta glow effect
- It appears to have a more intense, blurred glow compared to what I implemented
- The glow seems to pulse/breathe with a blur effect, not just text-shadow

## Phone Number Animation
- The phone number (888-451-2290) in the top right has a shake/vibrate animation
- It's in a purple-bordered container
- The animation appears to be periodic (happens every few seconds)

## Color Scheme
- PRIMARY: Purple/Magenta (#ad18fc, #a259ff range)
- NO BLUE AT ALL - everything is purple-based
- Buttons use solid purple (#ad18fc)
- The "GET STARTED" button is solid purple
- The "LEARN MORE" button has purple border with transparent background

## Background
- Dark grid pattern with scan lines
- Purple particle network animation
- Purple connecting lines between particles

## Navigation
- All navigation links are white/light gray
- Active/hover states show purple
- Phone number button has purple background with icon

## Key Issue
- I incorrectly kept some blue colors in the CSS
- Need to ensure ALL colors are purple-based only
